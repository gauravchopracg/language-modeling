# Language Modeling
Language modeling:
===
The aim of this repository is to illustrate how to create and train a neural network to predict the next word in a sequence (i.e. sequence of words), based on the preceding words in the sequence.

The process of building our language model will be as follows:
  * Pre-process our data (Data Preprocessing)
    * Convert to lowercase
    * Remove all the special characters
    * Remove all the numbers from text
  * Tokenization
    * Sentence tokenization
    * Remove extra spaces (leading and trailing)
  * Model Training
    * Choose an sequence model
    * Architecture and layers explanation
  * Optimize Hyperparameters
    * Epochs, Batch Size, Layers
    * Sample sentence prediction
